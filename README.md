 ## Description 
A functioning Mongo DB based budget tracking application is presented to us. Our job is to ensure that if the app goes offline, then it will continue recording transactions to the browser's Indexed database and proceed to write it to the mongo db once the browser is back online.
 ## Installation Instructions 
Move to the current directory then enter `npm install` then `npm start` and go to the address that is printed to the console.
 ## Usage Information 
The application is deployed on Heroku at https://budget-tracker-jk.herokuapp.com/ for you to try out.
 ## Contribution Guidelines 
Do whatever you'd like
 ## Test Instructions
